		<p class="masterofadministration">The first school of business in the United States was The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania established in 1881 through a donation from Joseph Wharton[4]. In 1900, the Tuck School of Business was founded at Dartmouth College[6] conferring the first advanced degree in business, specifically, a Master of Science in Commerce, the predecessor to the MBA.[7]

The Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration established the first MBA program in 1908, with 15 faculty members, 33 regular students and 47 special students.[8][9] Its first-year curriculum was based on Frederick Winslow Taylorâ€™s scientific management. The number of MBA students at Harvard increased quickly, from 80 in 1908, over 300 in 1920, and 1,070 in 1930.[10] At this time, only American universities offered MBAs. Other countries preferred that people learn business on the job.</p>
